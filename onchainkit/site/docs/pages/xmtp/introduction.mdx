# Introduction to XMTP Kit

XMTP Kit is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing developers to use only the parts of the protocol that they need.

In order to use **XMTP Kit** you must also install `@xmtp/frames-validator` in your app, alongside Onchainkit.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @coinbase/onchainkit @xmtp/frames-validator
```

:::

[XMTP](https://xmtp.org/) is a wallet to wallet messaging protocol, and many XMTP client applications are adding Frames support.

When a user interacts with a Frame inside an XMTP client application, you will need to handle the payload slightly differently from an interaction coming from Farcaster. The primary identifier for a user on Farcaster is the `fid`, while in XMTP it is the `verifiedWalletAddress`.

You can learn more about how XMTP works with frames in [their documentation here](https://xmtp.org/docs/build/frames).

To assist you in handling interactions from XMTP, and extracting the `verifiedWalletAddress` from a POST payload, here is the XMTP Kit which includes:

- [XMTP Kit](/xmtp/introduction)
  - Utilities:
    - [`getXmtpFrameMessage`](/xmtp/get-xmtp-frame-message)
    - [`isXmtpFrameRequest`](/xmtp/is-xmtp-frame-request)
