# Introduction to Farcaster Kit [A brief introduction on essential Farcaster knowledge.]

Farcaster is a decentralized social network on Ethereum.
Users create profiles, post "casts," and follow others.
They own their [accounts](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/what-is-farcaster/accounts) and relationships.

To join, users need an Ethereum address for onchain registration.

Farcaster [contracts](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/architecture/contracts) are deployed on Optimism, an Ethereum Layer 2 network.
Core contracts include ID Registry, Key Registry, and Storage Registry.

[ID Registry](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/id-registry) tracks Farcaster IDs (aka FID), linking them to Ethereum addresses. [Key Registry](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/contracts/reference/key-gateway) links Farcaster IDs with ed25519 public keys.

Only [messages](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/what-is-farcaster/messages) signed by registered keys are valid.
